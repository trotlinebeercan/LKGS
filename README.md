# Little-Known Galaxy - Instant Subliminal Learning (LKGS Mod)

This repo holds an all-in-one mod for [Little-Known Galaxy](https://linktr.ee/littleknowngalaxy).

Current features include:
- Increase time length of the day (slow the clock down)
- Pause the clock for the current location
- Infinite Stamina
- Infinite Health
- Open the Workbench and Kitchen for crafting from anywhere
- Open the in-game development debug menu for l33t h4x1ng

### Prerequisite

This is a [BepInEx 5](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) mod and as such requires that you have BepInEx 5 installed and working properly. If you've not done that yet, please go to their [documentation](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html) on how to get it installed. 

You want the Stable (5.x - 5.4.21 LTS at the time of writing) **MONO** build when you're presented with choices.

If you already know how to get BepInEx working, head over to their [Releases](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) to grab the latest copy.

### Recommended

LKGS supports configuration through [BepInEx Configuration Manager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager). I'd recommend it for easier configuration of this mod.

### Mod Installation

Head over to [Releases](https://github.com/trotlinebeercan/LKGS/releases), download the latest, and extract the archive into your BepInEx plugins folder in the game root.

If everything is done correctly, you should see the mod installed under `SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Little-Known Galaxy\BepInEx\plugins\LKGS`.

### Building from Source

Once you have a working BepInEx 5 Mono installation running successfully, you can build this repo and the plugins will be automatically staged into your game folder.

You should find the mod installed under `SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Little-Known Galaxy\BepInEx\plugins\LKGS`.
